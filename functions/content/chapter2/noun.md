Another important building block of greek sentances are the nouns. These are similar to english but their relation to other words is very different. In this module we will focus on masculine and neuter nouns which follow the second declension (grouping), but later we will learn two other declentions and their forms. For now let's focus on learning the three dynamics of a noun. It is important to learn these forms because unlike in english the word order is not relevant and its the form of the words that determine the objects position in the sentance.

1. Gender
2. Number
3. Case

# Gender
Every noun has a gender, these genders are masculine, feminine and neuter. These nouns then have grouping based on their gender, but overlaps between the genders.

## The second declension
This declension contains both masculine and neuter nouns. It shares a common letter sigma "ο". For example, ἀνθρωπος (man) is masculine and δωρον (gift) is neuter.

# Number
Every noun also will distinguish between singular and plural. This is very similar to how we had different forms for the verbs based on if the subject was singular or plural. In the case of the nouns it is the noun itself that determines it's number. For example δωρον is gift but δωρα is gifts.

# Case
Each noun also plays a different role in the sentance and this determines it's case. There are five main cases to learn

## Nominative 
This case points us to the noun as the subject of the sentance. For example in the sentance, "The man was intelligent", the man would be the subject of the sentance.
## Genitive
This case shows possession of a noun. For example, "ἄδελθός (brother) ἀνθρωπος (man) λεγει (speaks)", communicates that "a brother of a man speaks".
## Dative
This case shows that the noun is an indirect object in the sentance. Essentially an action is being applied indirectly to this noun. ἄδελθός (brother) ἀνθρωπω (man) λεγει (speaks), communicates "a brother speaks to a man
## Accusative
This case shows that an action is being directly applied to that object. In english if a ball is thrown to someone, it is not the person who is the direct object of that verb but the ball itself. 
ἄδελθός (brother) λόγος (a word) λεγει (speaks) would communicate that a brother speaks a word.

## Vocative
This final case is used when addressing someone as if in a letter. An example from scripture is O Theophilus, which is the opening to  Luke-Acts in scripture.
